Snake Game 🐍
Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic game is built using Python and Tkinter, allowing you to play and enjoy the nostalgia of guiding a snake to grow by eating food. The game gets progressively more challenging as the snake speeds up when you score higher!

🎮 Features

Scoreboard: Your current score is displayed on the screen.
Countdown Timer: Enjoy a countdown before the game begins.
Restart & Quit Options: Easily restart the game or quit anytime.
Keyboard Controls: Use arrow keys to navigate the snake.

💡 How It Works
